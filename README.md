Yet another gen 3 pokemon save editor
========

The goal of this save editor is to provide an easy way to edit a pokeemerald-expansion-based rom hack's save file by directly parsing the rom file to fetch the available pokemon, moves, items or abilities dynamically in order to support fakemons aswell as custom moves, items and abilities out of the box.
